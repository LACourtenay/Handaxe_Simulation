# Handaxe_Simulation
A set of functions and files with code to perform theoretical experiments, simulating geometric icons similar to handaxes as well as code for the analysis 
of handaxe morphology using either geometric morphometrics of Fourier morphological descriptors

## <b> Repository Details </b>

Prior to using any of the code, the functions.R file should first be sourced (while the user must also first check that all libraries are installed). Once the functions.R file has been sourced all code from other files should work fine. The functions.R file additionally contains some details about how to use each of the functions, while the code used to generate figures from the aforementioned study has been included in each of the separate files;

* <b>Experiments.R</b> contains all code used to perform the main study, as well as examples of code that can be used to perform analyses
using the different types of sliding procedures for semilandmarks.
* <b>compare_pca_cva.R</b> contains code used to compare PCA and CVA for the analysis of 3 identical theoretical bifacial handaxes.
* <b>Cohens_Delta_Code.py</b> contains example python code for the calculation of Cohen's delta values.
